# 🌾 AI-Based Fertilizer Optimization & Crop Recommendation System 🤖


## 🌟 Introduction

The **AI-Based Fertilizer Optimization & Crop Recommendation System** is an innovative agritech solution designed to boost agricultural productivity using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This project was proudly presented at the **Smart India Hackathon 2024 (Finals)** 🇮🇳, under the **Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare**, and it aims to provide farmers with a smart and data-driven way to:

- 🌱 Recommend suitable crops based on soil and environmental parameters.
- 🧪 Suggest optimal fertilizers to increase yield while maintaining soil health.
- 📊 Make farming more sustainable and efficient with minimal resource wastage.

## ⚙️ Process of Implementation

Here's how the system was implemented step-by-step:

1. **🔍 Real-Time Prediction Engine**  
   - Built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas** to predict the **most suitable crop** using real-time **weather and soil parameters**.

2. **🧪 Soil Deficiency Detection**  
   - Conducted **comparative analysis** with standard nutrient benchmarks to **identify soil nutrient deficiencies** accurately.

3. **📈 Fertilizer Recommendation Model**  
   - Designed a **custom fit-score model** to recommend the most **effective fertilizer combinations**.  
   - Achieved **95% accuracy** in both **crop prediction** and **fertilizer matching**.

4. **⚖️ Fertilizer Quantity Optimization**  
   - Calculated **precise fertilizer quantities** to restore soil balance.  
   - Split doses into **3–4 application batches** to improve **usability** and **boost crop yield by 15%**.

5. **🌐 Terrain & INM Integration**  
   - Included **terrain analysis** and **organic–inorganic fertilizer blending** using **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)**.  
   - This helped reduce **fertilizer costs by 20%** while benefiting **100+ acres of farmland**.

6. **💰 Cost-Efficiency Optimization**  
   - Applied **nutrient-to-cost ratio analysis** to ensure **economically sustainable** and resource-efficient fertilizer recommendations.
